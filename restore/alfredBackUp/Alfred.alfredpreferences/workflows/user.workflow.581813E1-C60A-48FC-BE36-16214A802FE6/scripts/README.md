Scripts
=======

The scripts in this folder are (most of) the built-in URL actions.

Don't add your own scripts to this directory: they'll be deleted when you update the workflow. Instead, add your custom scripts to the `scripts` subdirectory of the workflow's data directory, which you can quickly access via the `ffass` keyword and the `Open Scripts Directory` item.

See [the documentation][docs] for details on adding and customising scripts.
