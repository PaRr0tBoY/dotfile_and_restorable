## üóìÔ∏è 2024.06.29 | v1.0.3
1. This version mainly addresses a minor issue in Vivaldi 6.8 update‚Äî[Issue#20](https://github.com/tovifun/VivalArc/issues/20). (Special thanks to @NextEcho for providing CSS solutions, although I did not entirely adopt their method in the end).
2. In previous versions, I created a few gradient Vivaldi themes to mimic the Arc style and included them in the project files for everyone to use. A few days ago, I explored the Themes section on the Vivaldi Community and discovered many suitable themes. I realized there was no need to go out of my way to create new themes, so I tried some of the popular themes in the Community and selected a few that I found fitting. Here‚Äôs how you can use them:
	1.	Open the [recommended theme link](./curated-themes.md).
	2.	Click on the theme name to go to its page.
	3.	Click the install button below the theme.

## üóìÔ∏è 2024.05.12 | v1.0.2
- The latest version of VivalArc primarily focuses on optimizing two aspects of Vivaldi 6.7Ôºö
  - The window buttons in the top-left corner of macOS can no longer be customized, causing them to overlapping the elements of the TabBar
  - The 'Add Button' for creating new tabs has been relocated to the bottom of the window

## üóìÔ∏è 2024.03.30
- Optimized the height of the title bar

## üóìÔ∏è 2023.11.09
- Increase the gap on both sides of the Tabbar.
- The Tabbar is now draggable by default (if you don't want it to be draggable, you can change `.tabbar-wrapper` to `no-drag` in file `main_arc.css`.)
- The pop-up settings page now has a proper title bar (in previous versions, the close button was very small).
- Two new themes added, `theme-gradientGreenLight` and `theme-gradientPinkLight`.
- One thing I still want to modify is the Tabbar, it's still a bit rough at the moment, and it should be specifically optimized in future versions.

## üóìÔ∏è 2023.09.17
- This update includes many changes. I have reviewed every line of code to make the styles more refined.
- The main updates are as follows:
  - The shadows on the webview areas have been made more subtle.
  - Panel optimization for more consistent styles across various configurations.
  - Uniform colors for the Tabbar and Menubar.
- For those who want to customize more, I was planning to create a video demonstration, but the video isn't ready yet. You can follow my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmcO7HxXDYqEZFb-QgmRsw) for updates. Once the demo video is ready, I will post it there. For now, you can open `css/main.css` to make some additional configurations. Here are some brief instructions:
  - `--window-border` allows you to set the thickness of the border around the window. I recommend setting it between 4px and 16px. (Setting it to 0 means no border.)
  - `--window-button-opacity` lets you adjust the opacity of the three buttons in the top right corner for Windows users. I've set it to 0.3 by default. You can set it any num between 0 and 1. Higher values make the buttons more visible. If set to around 0.1, they become almost invisible but still appear on mouse hover. If you want a cleaner header, you can set it below 0.1.
  - If you find the drag area for the top header too small, you can increase the `--window-header` value, or you can use the following method:
  - Change the `webkit-app-region` of `tabbar-wrapper` from `nodrag` to `drag` to make the entire tabbar draggable. However, some users have reported that dragging in this area may affect the left-side panel (the right-side panel should be less problematic, as I have set it to the right myself). If you encounter any issues during testing, please provide feedback.
  - Please note that if you make the tabbar area draggable, the double-click to create a new tab feature in the tabbar area will be disabled. You can comment out the "display new tab button" above to add a new tab button to the tabbar area.
- **Note: After making CSS modifications, you will need to restart your browser for the changes to take effect.**

- Several users on Windows reported that they couldn't see the three window buttons, which was very awkward, so I added them back this time.
- The three buttons in the upper-left corner of the Mac are also added back, but for the sake of aesthetics, they are grayed out, and only colored when the mouse hovers over them.

## üóìÔ∏è 2023.03.12
- Optimization
    - Hide the border around the window when in full screen mode;
    - Show the title bar and keep the three buttons in the upper-left corner visible (many users had trouble finding them);
    - Remove drag-and-drop for the Tab bar (it caused many unexpected bugs);
    - Simplify the style sheet
        - Previously, too many custom CSS styles were used to make the appearance match Arc as closely as possible, which caused some styles to break when Vivaldi was updated. Therefore, a principle was established this time to not blindly pursue perfect styling, but rather use as little CSS as possible;

## üóìÔ∏è 2022.08.28 Background: Why I made this
To give some background, I've been using the Vivaldi browser as my primary browser for about a year now. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the Arc browser, which was still in beta testing at the time, for about two weeks. The experience of using Arc during those two weeks was really good - the interactions felt intuitive, and the UI was very aesthetically pleasing.

However, I eventually switched back to Vivaldi primarily because Arc crashed a few times during use.

Later, I learned that Vivaldi actually allows for UI customization using CSS, so I decided to give it a try. The result is the configuration that is described on this webpage.

While the final result doesn't quite measure up to Arc's UI and attention to detail, I feel that this configuration provides a similar user experience. So I wanted to share this configuration with everyone who is still waiting to test out Arc, or who might be looking for an alternative due to Arc's memory usage.
